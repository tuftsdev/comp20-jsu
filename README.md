This repository holds the numerous amounts of projects completed in Comp 20 - Web Programming at Tufts University. It also documents the progress of the student and how the student improves in terms of coding style and standards of web-based programming.

My favorite assignment was assignment 2 because it was the first time we used an API and had to traverse a JSON to get the desired data. We also had to create a graphical notifier for the user so that users can use it easily. One final comment is that this assignment is actually practical and shows one application of web programming and its potential.

I think I have grown from day 1 of this course from not knowing how the web works at all to understanding the contracts between the client, the server, an api, and a database and how they can interact with each other.

One important thing I learned in this course was, as stated before, the interaction between servers, apis, and clients. Our assignment 3 of letting the client send data to the server to put in a database and to retrieve data is almost exactly what we wanted to do in our semester project - sort by scores and storing a json into a database. In another extension to this concept, in our semester project group we were able to split our group into two distinct groups that had distinct responsibilities because we understood the different sides of the web application we were trying to build.

One topic I would like to delve deeper into is the use of APIs. There are an extremely large amount of APIs available to people and I have only used a few. There is so much potential that can be done and I did not take advantage of it at the Polyhack this fall. In the next hackathon I attend, I hope to research more about interesting apis and implementing them in an effective and useful way.
